There are 5 different types of code. In all arenas,you're going to need frameworks.

### Structure

#### Framework: Foundation

#### Compiler: Panini, Jekyll

This is your markup code. In this arena, you're going to need a responsive framework so that your structure will be flexible across multiple device types. Content is king in the new marketplace, and getting your content out there is the name of the game.

### Style

#### Framework: Foundation

#### Compiler: SASS

This is your stylesheet. Writing good style code is more art than science. The less you do - the better. As a project progresses, the amount of style code written quickly balloons to a size that can spiral out of control.

### Effect

#### Framework: jQuery

#### Compiler: Coffeescript

I don't know a god damned thing about coffeescript. I should get on that. People swear by it.

### Logic

#### Framework: Jekyll, the CMS du jour.
